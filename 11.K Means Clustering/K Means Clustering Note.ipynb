    "### What is K-Means Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning organizes data without prior labels by identifying patterns and similarities.  \n",
    "- K-Means assigns data points to **K clusters** based on their distance to cluster centroids.  \n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "  1. Randomly initialize cluster centroids.\n",
    "  2. Assign points to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "  3. Recalculate centroids based on assignments.\n",
    "  4. Repeat until clusters stabilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Notes**:  \n",
    "- Requires **K (number of clusters)** to be predefined.  \n",
    "- Works well with well-separated data; sensitive to noise and initialization.  \n",
    "- May get stuck in local minima and lacks robust cluster quality metrics.\n",

    "### Objective of K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "To group data into clusters such that points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How K-Means Clustering Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Represent items as points in **n-dimensional space**.  \n",
    "2. Use **Euclidean distance** to measure similarity.  \n",
    "3. Algorithm steps:  \n",
    "   - Initialize **K centroids** randomly.  \n",
    "   - For each point:  \n",
    "     - Assign it to the nearest centroid.  \n",
    "     - Recalculate centroid as the mean of its assigned points.  \n",
    "   - Repeat for a set number of iterations or until convergence.\n",

    "        Calculate its Euclidean distance to all means.\n",
    "        Assign it to the nearest mean.\n",
    "        Update mean to the average of its assigned items.\n"

    "1. **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)**: Measures variance within clusters. Lower WCSS indicates tighter clusters.  \n",

    "   - Run K-Means for different values of K (e.g., 1 to 10).  \n",
    "   - Calculate the WCSS for each K.  \n",
