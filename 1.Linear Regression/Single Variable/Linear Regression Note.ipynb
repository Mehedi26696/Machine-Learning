    "# Types of Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method for modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. The two main types of linear regression are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Equation**: y = β0 + β1X\n",
    "  - y: Dependent variable (response)\n",
    "  - X: Independent variable (predictor)\n",
    "  - β0: Intercept (value of y when X = 0)\n",
    "  - β1: Slope (rate of change of y with respect to X)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equation for Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Equation: y = β0 + β1X\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- Y is the dependent variable\n",
    "- X is the independent variable\n",
    "- β0 is the intercept\n",
    "- β1 is the slope\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multiple Linear Regression\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to find the best-fit line equation that can predict the values based on the independent variables.\n",
    "In regression, a set of records is present with X and Y values, and these values are used to learn a function so if you want to predict Y from an unknown X, this learned function can be used.\n",
    "In regression, we have to find the value of Y, so a function is required that predicts continuous Y in the case of regression given X as independent features.\n"

    "# Model Evaluation in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing a linear regression model, it's crucial to evaluate its performance to ensure that it accurately predicts outcomes based on input features. Two widely used metrics for this purpose are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). Below, we will delve into each of these metrics, explaining their significance and how they are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared differences between predicted values and actual values. It quantifies how close the predicted values are to the true values, making it a vital metric for assessing the accuracy of regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "The formula for MSE is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **n** is the number of data points.\n",
    "- **$y_i$** is the actual value.\n",
    "- **$\\hat{y}_i$** is the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data, as it signifies that the predicted values are closer to the actual values.\n",
    "- MSE is sensitive to outliers because it squares the errors, which means larger errors have a disproportionately large effect on the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## R-Squared (R²)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "The formula for R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **$y_i$** is the actual value.\n",
    "- **$\\hat{y}_i$** is the predicted value.\n",
    "- **$\\bar{y}$** is the mean of the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- The numerator ($\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$) is the **sum of squared residuals** (model error).\n",
    "- The denominator ($\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$) is the **total sum of squares** (total variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 1$**: The model captures 100% of the variance (perfect fit).\n",
    "- **$R^2 = 0$**: The model captures none of the variance (as good as the mean).\n",
    "- **$R^2 < 0$**: The model performs worse than a simple horizontal line at the mean."
