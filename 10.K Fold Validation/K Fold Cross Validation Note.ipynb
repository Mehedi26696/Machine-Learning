    "# What is k-Fold Cross-Validation?\n",
    "- A resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models.\n",
    "- Splits the dataset into k groups or \"folds.\"\n",
    "- Ensures each data point is used for both training and testing exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use k-Fold Cross-Validation?\n",
    "- Reduces the risk of overfitting by evaluating the model multiple times.\n",
    "- Provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a single train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "# General Procedure\n",
    "1. Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into k folds.\n",
    "3. For each fold:\n",
    "   - Use the fold as the test set.\n",
    "   - Use the remaining folds as the training set.\n",
    "   - Train the model and evaluate it.\n",
    "   - Retain the evaluation score and discard the model.\n",
    "4. Summarize the results using the mean and standard deviation of the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Important Considerations\n",
    "- Data preparation (e.g., scaling, feature engineering) must be done within each fold to prevent data leakage.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning should also occur within the cross-validation loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common Configurations for k\n",
    "1. **k = 10**: Default choice for balancing bias and variance.\n",
    "2. **k = n (Leave-One-Out CV)**: Each sample is used once as a test set; computationally expensive.\n",
    "3. **Representative k**: Chosen based on ensuring the folds are large enough to be statistically representative."
