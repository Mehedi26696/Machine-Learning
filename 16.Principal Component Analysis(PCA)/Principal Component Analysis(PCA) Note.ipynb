    "# Why PCA?\n",
    "High-dimensional datasets often suffer from the **curse of dimensionality**, leading to:\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**: Models fail to generalize to new data.\n",
    "2. **Increased computational complexity**: Processing becomes expensive.\n",
    "3. **Reduced accuracy**: Algorithms struggle to perform effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these, we use **dimensionality reduction** techniques like PCA, which:\n",
    "- Reduce the number of features while retaining maximum variance.\n",
    "- Simplify data for visualization, modeling, and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is PCA?\n",
    "PCA, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1901, is a statistical method that:\n",
    "- **Transforms correlated variables** into a set of uncorrelated variables (principal components).\n",
    "- **Identifies the axes of maximum variance** in the data.\n",
    "- Reduces the dimensionality of datasets while preserving essential patterns and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Features of PCA\n",
    "1. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithm**: Does not rely on target variables.\n",
    "2. **Applications**:\n",
    "   - **Data Visualization**: Reduces data to 2 or 3 dimensions for easier plotting.\n",
    "   - **Feature Selection**: Identifies significant variables.\n",
    "   - **Data Compression**: Reduces dataset size without significant information loss.\n",
    "3. **Assumption**: Variance carries most of the information in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps in PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Standardization**\n",
    "Standardize the dataset to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ \\mu $: Mean of features.\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $: Standard deviation of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Compute Covariance Matrix**\n",
    "The covariance matrix captures the joint variability between features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{cov}(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{1i} - \\bar{x}_1)(x_{2i} - \\bar{x}_2)}{n-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance indicates:\n",
    "- **Positive**: Variables increase together.\n",
    "- **Negative**: One variable increases while the other decreases.\n",
    "- **Zero**: No relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**\n",
    "Solve for eigenvalues ($ \\lambda $) and eigenvectors ($ X $) of the covariance matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ AX = \\lambda X $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ A $: Covariance matrix.\n",
    "- $ \\lambda $: Eigenvalues (variance captured by each principal component).\n",
    "- $ X $: Eigenvectors (directions of principal components).\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |A - \\lambda I| = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ I $ is the identity matrix of the same dimension as $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Principal Components\n",
    "1. **First Principal Component**: Captures the maximum variance in the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Subsequent Components**: Capture remaining variance, orthogonal to earlier components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Benefits of PCA\n",
    "1. **Simplifies Complex Data**: Helps in understanding high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "2. **Improves Model Performance**: Reduces risk of overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Reduces Computational Cost**: Less data to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and exploratory data analysis, making it indispensable in machine learning and data science.\n"
