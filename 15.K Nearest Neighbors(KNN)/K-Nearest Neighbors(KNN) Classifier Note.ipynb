    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Non-parametric:** No assumptions about data distribution.\n",
    "- **Flexible:** Handles both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement with minimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **Versatility:** Suitable for both classification (majority vote) and regression (average or weighted average).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Basis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance Metrics:**\n",
    "KNN uses distance metrics to measure the similarity between data points. Common metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Euclidean Distance:**\n",
    "$$\\small d(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manhattan Distance:**\n",
    "$$\\small d(x, y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minkowski Distance:**\n",
    "$$\\small d(x, y) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special cases:**\n",
    "- When $p=2$, it is equivalent to Euclidean distance.\n",
    "- When $p=1$, it is equivalent to Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hamming Distance (for categorical data):**\n",
    "$$\\small d(x, y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{1 if } x_i \\neq y_i \\text{ else 0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Majority Voting (Classification):**\n",
    "For classification tasks, the predicted class $\\hat{y}$ for a query point is determined by the majority class among its $k$-nearest neighbors:\n",
    "$$\\small \\hat{y} = \\text{mode}(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Averaging (Regression):**\n",
    "For regression tasks, the predicted value $\\hat{y}$ for a query point is the average value of its $k$-nearest neighbors:\n",
    "$$\\small \\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} y_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted KNN:**\n",
    "Neighbors closer to the query point can be given more weight to reduce the effect of outliers:\n",
    "$$\\small \\hat{y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i}, \\quad \\text{where } w_i = \\frac{1}{d(x, x_i) + \\epsilon}$$\n",
    "Here, $\\epsilon$ is a small value to prevent division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How KNN Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Value of $k$:**\n",
    "- Larger $k$: Reduces noise sensitivity, but loses detail.\n",
    "- Odd $k$: Prevents ties in classification.\n",
    "- Cross-validation can help determine the optimal $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance Calculation:**\n",
    "Compute the distance between the test data point and each training data point using one of the above metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find Nearest Neighbors:**\n",
    "Identify the $k$-closest points based on the smallest distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction:**\n",
    "- **Classification:** Perform majority voting to assign a class.\n",
    "- **Regression:** Compute the average (or weighted average) of the $k$-nearest neighborsâ€™ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Easy to implement with minimal computation during training.\n",
    "- Adaptive to new data, as it considers all training examples for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Computationally expensive for large datasets, as it requires calculating distances for every prediction.\n",
    "- Suffers from the **curse of dimensionality**, making it less effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- Sensitive to noisy and imbalanced data without preprocessing.\n"
